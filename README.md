Provides node.js based services for a personal website. I've been pounding out Java
code for too long. It's time to move on to something that is closer to the real web
and JavaScript looks like a natural place to go. Node.js is clearly a healthy ecosystem
of JavaScript modules to build with, so this is my playground for learning the joy of
server side JavaScript.
